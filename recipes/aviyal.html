    <h1> Aviyal </h1>
    <br/> 
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>Aviyal is a traditional Kerala dish known for its medley of flavors and colorful assortment of vegetables. It is a vegetarian curry made with a variety of vegetables, coconut, and yogurt. Aviyal is often served as part of the traditional Kerala feast called "Sadya" during festivals and special occasions.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, beans, raw plantain, ash gourd, drumsticks, pumpkin, etc.), cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated coconut</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1-2 green chilies, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 sprig curry leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1-2 dried red chilies</li>
        <li>A pinch of asafoetida (hing)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot or pan, add the mixed vegetables along with enough water to cover them. Add turmeric powder and salt, and cook the vegetables until they are tender. Ensure not to overcook them, so they retain their shape and color.</li>
        <li>While the vegetables are cooking, grind the grated coconut, green chilies, and cumin seeds to a coarse paste in a blender or food processor. You can add a little water if needed to aid in grinding.</li>
        <li>Once the vegetables are cooked, drain any excess water and keep them aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pot or a separate pan, mix the cooked vegetables with the ground coconut paste.</li>
        <li>Place the pot over low heat and add the plain yogurt. Mix well to combine all the ingredients. Be careful not to let the mixture come to a boil to prevent curdling of the yogurt.</li>
        <li>In a separate small pan, heat coconut oil over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Then add dried red chilies, curry leaves, and a pinch of asafoetida.</li>
        <li>Pour the seasoned oil over the Aviyal mixture, and gently stir everything together.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and cover the pot with a lid to allow the flavors to meld for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Aviyal is now ready to be served. It pairs well with steamed rice, adai (Kerala-style savory pancakes), or even with parotta.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy the wholesome and delightful Aviyal, a true representation of Kerala's rich and diverse cuisine!</p>
